	 * translucent or animated geometry even when it does not. It is up to the implementor of the model to decide how
	 * much the model should generalize its flags. This decision is primarily informed by how dynamic the model is and
	 * how often it is expected to be rendered. More generalized flags are cheaper to compute and use less context,
	 * but are less accurate, which can result in performance loss elsewhere in the rendering pipeline. As
	 * {@link BlockStateModel#materialFlags()} does not receive any context, it must return the most generalized flags,
	 * which must be functionally correct in all possible level contexts.
	 *
	 * <p>The result of this method is inherently tied to the result of
	 * {@link #emitQuads(QuadEmitter, BlockAndTintGetter, BlockPos, BlockState, RandomSource, Predicate)}. It is
	 * required that, for some level context and an arbitrary cull test, applying
	 * {@link ModelHelper#computeMaterialFlags(QuadView)} to every quad output by
	 * {@link #emitQuads(QuadEmitter, BlockAndTintGetter, BlockPos, BlockState, RandomSource, Predicate)} must produce
	 * flags that are at least as accurate as the result of this method. In other words, code that uses this model may,
